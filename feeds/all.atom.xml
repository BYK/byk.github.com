annoying browser bugs. Both were only happening on iOS, which reminded me the 
famous quote from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt;:
 "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, 
must be the truth".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was a bad one. We had reports from users not being able to login
to our system from the embedded commenting widget, but only on iOS. The
symptoms were even stranger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users were shown the login page in a popup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users could login and the cookie was set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The popup stayed open but notified the embed about the logged in user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The embed did not recognize the logged in user until after a refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started debugging and discovered that the embed actually makes a call to
get details of the logged in user after it gets the notification from the
popup. However, the result of the request was never processed. Moreso, if you
refreshed the popup and then closed it, it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent many hours in the iPhone emulator, mostly due to the cumbersome nature
 of all the emulators, we discovered that if you ever opened a popup and held a
 reference to it, iOS suspends the events on the parent page but still executes
 some of the code. So, in our case, the XHR call was being made and the
response was receieved, but the callback was not called. The cause of our bug
reports was this callback being responsible for closing the login popup. The
embed was dead-locked for waiting for the request to finish to close the popup
and the browser was waiting for the popup to close to fire the callback. As you
 can imagine, there were no visible reports of this behavior, anywhere on the
internets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one was even weirder: we were seeing a certain content being repeated
exactly three times whereas it should have appended to the DOM only once. The
intermittent nature of the problem suggested a hard-to-track race condition but
 that turned out not to be the case. We were able to mitigate the problem
easily by emptying the parent element before appending the content. This was
only a symptomatic cure though so we proceeded on our adventure to find the root
cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many hours of debugging, which was also very cumbersome due to the
specific "ritual" to reproduce it consistently, we traced the problem to the
XHR success callback getting called 3 times with &lt;code&gt;readyState == 4&lt;/code&gt; instead of
only once. The new information suggested, surprise, a race condition, but
tracking the number of XHR objects eliminated that possibility entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the &lt;code&gt;onreadystatechange&lt;/code&gt; event was getting fired even though
&lt;code&gt;readyState&lt;/code&gt; did not change at all. Not surprisingly, since this was happening
at the &lt;strong&gt;completed&lt;/strong&gt; state, the callback was fired multiple times for the same
request. A Google search revealed another poor soul who encountered the same
issue: 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/pull/633"&gt;https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/pull/633&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it was: a weird, hard-to-reproduce browser bug breaking our product
randomly. After realizing this fact, we went ahead and did what we had to do:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ded/reqwest/pull/93"&gt;patched Reqwest&lt;/a&gt;, the XHR library we
use at Disqus.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="browser"></category><category term="javascript"></category></entry></feed>
